I'm a Software Engineer working in an exciting Agile/XP Product Development Team in London.
With years behind me as a Solutions Engineer for a fast-growing Online Video Technology business, I have proven experience investigating, debugging and fixing all manner of technical and business challenges in a flexible way.

Now, I'm looking to gain experience in Software Development with a view to quickly expand my technical skill set.

After time spent hacking away on a range of projects including websites for creative start-ups, and interactive art installations, Iâ€™m excited to take the reins on moving my career to the heart of modern Software Development - writing robust code by collaborating with a team in an Agile Development environment.
