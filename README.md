I'm a Software Engineer with a Solutions background, coming from an XP Product-Development Team in a fast-growing Online Video Tech business.
I have a proven track record investigating, debugging and fixing all manner of technical and business challenges in a flexible way.

After time spent hacking away on a range of projects including interactive art installations and websites for creative start-ups, Iâ€™m excited to take the reins on moving my career to the heart of modern Software Development - writing robust code by collaborating with a team in an Agile Development environment.

## Skills

#### Web Debugging

As a Senior Solutions Engineer, a lot of time was spent debugging 1st and 3rd-party code in the browser on hundreds of premium publisher's webpages, as a result I built a range of strong technical and problem-solving skills while solving tech and business problems, boosting revenue in real-terms or otherwise enabling the opportunity for it.

- Fluency with Browser Dev Tools' features - Strong understanding of HTTP, the DOM, cookies.
- Experienced with in-browser debugging by stepping through client-side (often minified) JS using breakpoints.
- User of Charles Proxy and Requestly, to play with Network Requests and Response payloads for testing purposes.

#### Databases, Data Analysis

Often part of the daily exploratory problem-solving tasks undertaken at Unruly involves writing database queries and understanding/explaining the resulting data in non-technical terms to stakeholders from around the business.

- Strong SQL knowledge, daily use of Postgres and Vectorwise.
- Well-versed with Splunk, a tool used for ad-hoc querying against massive datasets.

#### Digital Art, Web Design

Over the course of 5 years, I've many accomplishments as a Freelance Artist and Designer, primarily working in Digital Media, often Multimedia. My responsibilities on projects is usually to deliver some kind of art object/project to a client, working independently. Occasionally teamwork is required in the case of the running of an arts event for example. The range of media used and varied nature of clients have proven my ability to learn fresh skills while dealing with new situations responsibly and quickly.
